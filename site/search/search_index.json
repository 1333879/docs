Bittrex, Shapeshift, Airswap, 0x, Upbit, DDEX, Paradex Is there a telegram ? Yes https://t.me/joinchat/FluX1UoXVyd08zhrgwZLqQ Data What are the features and ids in the dataset ? The features and ids of the dataset are intentionally obfuscated to remove human bias from the data science. Why isn't the data for past rounds included in the training data of subsequent rounds ? There is a trade off between the length of the test data (used in our backtest) which gives us a lot of information to build the meta model and the length of the training data which gives users more information. Particularly, we like that our test set Sharpe is calculated on a large set of data. If we turned the test data into training data, we wouldn't have much to go on unless the staking tournament was working perfectly and users got extremely good at estimating p and communicating it through stakes.
