# Technical Support

Numerai's data science community lives primarily at [RocketChat](https://community.numer.ai/). If you are having problems with our data, API or website, please contact us on the \#[support channel](https://community.numer.ai/channel/support) and we will get back to you ASAP.

Look for the `Admin` or `Team` tag to identify the Numerai team. At any given time, one Numerai engineer will be available for technical support. We will try our best to get back to you within 24 hours. We will **NEVER** ask for your password, secret keys or have you send us any money.

Email us at support@numer.ai

If you intend to hold NMR in our wallet, we strongly advise you to enable MFA to secure your account. Please make sure to keep your MFA backup codes in a safe place accessible to yourself as **we will not** **recover your account** if you lose your MFA device.
