Step by step. \u00b6 1. Download Data \u00b6 After you have created an account and logged in, the latest data can be found at the Tournament Page : Note: You only need to download the data once per week, it includes information from all our Tournaments. Our current download folder \ud83d\udcc1 numerai-datasets includes the following files: example_model.py example_model.r example_predictions_target_bernie.csv example_predictions_target_charles.csv example_predictions_target_elizabeth.csv example_predictions_target_jordan.csv example_predictions_target_ken.csv numerai_tournament_data.csv numerai_training_data.csv numerox_example.py What's in each file ? example_model.py , example_model.r : A heavily commented interactive example of how to read the dataset, train a model, make and create submissions and other details in python and r. example_predictions_target_bernie.csv , example_predictions_target_charles.csv , example_predictions_target_elizabeth.csv , example_predictions_target_jordan.csv , example_predictions_target_ken.csv : Example predictions for each of the 5 tournaments & targets, we expect you to upload predictions in this format. numerai_training_data.csv \u2757 : Our training dataset, use it to train your model. numerai_tournament_data.csv \u2757 : Once your model is trained, use this dataset to generate your predictions. numerox_example.py : Numerox is a 3 rd party toolbox for submitting and evaluating models, this is a basic use example. 2. Create Predictions \u00b6 Once you have downloaded the dataset and familiarized yourself with it, you can start creating your own models and generating predictions. A good place to start is the example_model.py or example_model.r files which use a logistic regression classifier as a starting point. Targets Be aware of the different targets and submit in the correct file format to the correct tournament, for example ( in python ): Training: Y_train = training_data [ \"target_ken\" ] Predicting: y_prediction = model . predict_probabilities ( validation [ \"features_target_ken\" ]) Submission File: predictionsKen.csv id,probability_ken nc89137dfd782464,0.4942169804417248 n5f7abc0a8646441,0.5040417878616712 n0268070abecb419,0.5119778573460162 ndaea9db3f8384dc,0.5041644642593843... etc Note: You can of course use targets from different tournaments as part of your models, check the example files for full examples and other relevant information. 3. Upload your predictions. \u00b6 Make sure you upload the correct prediction targets with the right file format to the correct tournament or your submission might fail. You can call your submission file anything you like, but the id's and column names need to be the correct ones, so for instance if you wanted to upload to the Bernie tournament your file, let's say you named it predictions_bernie.csv , it should have matching id's with our provided dataset: numerai_tournament_data.csv and the correct column names : id,probability_bernie nc89137dfd782464,0.49348768765828444 n5f7abc0a8646441,0.5161787424278924 n0268070abecb419,0.5158960837554011 ndaea9db3f8384dc,0.5032981123372411... etc 4. Validate your predictions \u00b6 Upon successfully uploading your predictions, they will be automatically validated and your submission file name will appear. Once validated ( you might need to refresh the page ) your submission score will appear : 5. Stake \u00b6 You can only stake when: 1. Staking is open ( currently the first 2 days after the round / tournament opens ) 2. Your model has achieved certain metrics. The UI will display your current stake eligibility along with the required metrics and your score: You will also need NMR to Stake ! You can acquire NMR at Shapeshift , Bittrex or other exchanges. Numerai also provides NMR to users which models beat certain metrics, ( currently 0.1 NMR for models that achieve Log Loss under 0.693 paid upon round resolution ). You can then stake via the staking screen: Quick guide to Staking: The minimum you can stake is 0.1 NMR. Probability signifies your estimate for your model passing benchmark (logloss < 0.693 ) and the minimum value is 0.1 (10% probability). You can stake multiple times but your NMR Stake or your Probability needs to be greater than your previous stake. Your Earning Potential depends on the current rules and other factors, currently stakes with probability below the moving cutoff probability are not considered for payouts or burns. Carefully review both fields before staking or updating your stake,once submitted they are final ! Once submitted, your stake will appear in the corresponding tournament ( you might need to wait for it to be included in the blockchain and refresh your page ). 6. Results \u00b6 Your submitted predictions will be used internally as part of our meta model over a period of time and graded on how well they perform, after that period ( currently 31 days ), your result along with that of others will be made public and you will receive a payout \ud83d\udcb0 if you staked and performed well or burn \ud83d\udd25 ( loose your stake ) if you performed poorly ( else your stake will be returned ), submitted models that did not stake are also graded and might be given NMR if they perform well (currently 0.1 NMR if their logloss is < 0.693 ). You can see how your model performed in the resolved tournament table: Please consult the rest of this documentation for more details.

If you see any mistakes or have any answers to add, please edit this page. Numeraire(NMR) is a cryptocurrency rewarded to data scientists who compete in a tournament to develop algorithms to predict and profit off of market trends. It is currently tradeable on Bittrex.com. The Tournament \u00b6 How many tournaments are there ? There are currently 5 tournaments. How long is each round of the tournament ? 1 week. When are round earnings paid out ? Weekly, 31 days after the start of the round. Does everybody get the same data ? Yes, the dataset download link is the same for everybody. Everyone gets the same data. How much USD or NMR is awarded ? Check out the https://numer.ai/rounds to see the prize pools for current round and tournaments. How are the weekly payouts determined ? See the Payouts section of the Tutorial . Does Numerai consider my best submission or only my latest submission? Numerai uses only the latest submission. Which of my submissions are considered for payout ? Only the last submission made by an account in a given round is considered for earnings. Why did you change the payouts from X to Y ? The payout structure has changed and will probably continue to change and evolve in response to model performance and the tournament rules, which in turn are an interplay in between users behavior, and said tournament rules. Account \u00b6 How do I withdraw earnings ? When logged in, see the \"WITHDRAW/DEPOSIT\" link at the bottom of your user wallet panel. How do I get an ether wallet to withdraw earnings into? How do I sell ether ? There are many ways to do this. The easiest is Coinbase . Set up a free account there. You can withdraw your Numerai ether earnings into your Coinbase account and sell the ether for USD and transfer to a bank account. How fast are USD or NMR withdraws from my account ? Expect less than 1 minute for the transaction to first appear on your account. How quickly the funds become available to sell from your account depends both on the service you're using as your wallet, as well as the current load on the eth blockchain . Typically it's less than 15 minutes. Numeraire \u00b6 What is Numeraire ? Numeraire (NMR) is Numerai's crypto currency. Learn more here . NMR is an ERC20 Ethereum token. The contract is here . Amounts of Numeraire are represented on the website using \ua7a4 , the unicode character U+A7A4 . Where can I get some NMR ? Bittrex, Shapeshift, Airswap, 0x, Upbit, DDEX, Paradex Is there a telegram ? Yes https://t.me/joinchat/FluX1UoXVyd08zhrgwZLqQ What is the current supply of NMR ?, How much is under Numerai's control ? NMR supply and distribution changes often, for the latest numbers please consult the contract on the blockchain . The following table summarizes publicly available information as of August 13 th 2018 : Total Supply 6,362,843 Mintable 1,554,219 Weekly Disbursement 96,154 Total Minted 6,433,454 Locked 3,000,000 Burned (Minted -supply) (70,611) Numerai (known wallet) 316,467 Under control (mintable+locked+Numerai Wallet) 4,870,686 Data \u00b6 What are the features and ids in the dataset ? The features and ids of the dataset are intentionally obfuscated to remove human bias from the data science. Why isn't the data for past rounds included in the training data of subsequent rounds ? There is a trade off between the length of the test data (used in our backtest) which gives us a lot of information to build the meta model and the length of the training data which gives users more information. Particularly, we like that our test set Sharpe is calculated on a large set of data. If we turned the test data into training data, we wouldn't have much to go on unless the staking tournament was working perfectly and users got extremely good at estimating p and communicating it through stakes. This is subject to change in the future. Company \u00b6 How well is Numerai's fund doing ? Numerai doesn't discuss this publicly. Can I invest in Numerai ? Numerai One, our Hedge Fund is intended for institutional investors with a $1 million minimum investment. I am an institutional investor, how do I invest ? Please email: contact@numer.ai Reputation \u00b6 What is this reputation that I hear about ? Reputation is the number of benchmark beat in the past 20 rounds across all tournaments Is there a bonus associated with reputation ? Retroactive bonus: 1 time bonus of 1 NMR for every benchmark beat before April 20 when you verify your phone number. Verification bonus: 1 time bonus of 0.1 NMR for verifying your phone number Reputation bonus: ongoing bonus of 0.1 NMR for every benchmark beat (if you have verified your phone number) How does phone number verification work ? Head over to the account to start phone verification process A single phone number can only be verified against one account You can remove your phone number and verify another if you wish, but you will only be paid the verification bonus once. Your phone number will not be used for anything apart from verification. Other \u00b6 Is there an API ? Use the open-source Numerapi , note that this is an external project. Any tips for first time competitors who are getting into machine learning ? The download of our data includes these example scripts in Python and R. Try starting with those. Also, this blog post might be helpful. Where can I go for more information ? There are community as well as a Telegram as well as a number of blog posts . Old but valid news \u00b6 Does Numerai still use bitcoin ? No. All USD earnings are paid out in ether. Is Numeraire fully released ? Yes. The initial distribution of NMR has been given to data scientists on the website, and data scientists can continue to win NMR in the weekly tournament. The NMR contract has been released on the Ethereum blockchain. Can I withdraw NMR ? Yes, you can withdraw your NMR from the Numerai website, and deposit it into any wallet that supports ERC20 tokens. Will there be a Numeraire ICO (Initial Coin Offering) ? No. The initial distribution of NMR has already been given out to all of Numerai's data scientists based on their historic performance in the tournament. Data scientists will earn NMR each week, just like they earn USD. What is -ln(0.5) used in the whitepaper ? -ln(0.5) = 0.6931471805599453... This is the logloss you'd expect to get from making completely random guesses. A logloss lower than this is better than random guessing.","title":"Faq"},{"location":"faq/#the-tournament","text":"How many tournaments are there ? There are currently 5 tournaments.
