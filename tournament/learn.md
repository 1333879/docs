# Tournament Overview

## Tournament Overview

### Introduction <a id="rounds"></a>

Numerai is a data science tournament that powers the Numerai hedge fund. Watch the [meta-model video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhJnt0N497c) to understand how it works at a high level.

The long term vision of Numerai is to manage all the money in the world with a decentralized network of autonomous AI agents. Read our [master plan](https://medium.com/numerai/numerais-master-plan-1a00f133dba9) to learn more.

This document is a brief overview of the tournament structure and rules. If you are new, start here!

### Data <a id="rounds"></a>

To make good predictions, you need good data. But production grade financial data is not easy to find. Hedge funds spend millions buying and managing this data, so they keep it secret.

Numerai provides this production grade financial data for free. Our data is [obfuscated](https://medium.com/numerai/encrypted-data-for-efficient-markets-fffbe9743ba8) to keep the actual assets and features secret while preserving underlying structure.

This is what our `training_data` looks like. Each `id` represents an asset with some abstract`features` and each `era` is a unit period of time in history. The `target` is an abstract measure of performance.

### Modeling <a id="rounds"></a>

Your task is to train a model to make predictions on the out-of-sample `tournament_data`. This dataset includes `validation` and `test` hold out sets, as well as `live` features of current stock market.

Here is a basic example model.

```python
import pandas as pd
from xgboost import XGBRegressor

# training data contains features and targets
training_data = pd.read_csv("numerai_training_data.csv").set_index("id")

# tournament data contains features only
tournament_data = pd.read_csv("numerai_tournament_data.csv").set_index("id")
feature_names = [f for f in training_data.columns if "feature" in f]

# train a model to make predictions on tournament data
model = XGBRegressor(max_depth=5, learning_rate=0.01, \
                     n_estimators=2000, colsample_bytree=0.1)
model.fit(training_data[feature_names], training_data["target"])

# submit predictions to numer.ai
predictions = model.predict(tournament_data[feature_names])
predictions.to_csv("predictions.csv")
```

To help you get started, we have also written two detailed walkthroughs of the problem in [Python](https://github.com/numerai/example-scripts/blob/master/analysis_and_tips.ipynb) and [R](https://github.com/numerai/example-scripts/blob/master/example_model.r). These guides cover key concepts such as feature importance, cross validation, consistency, overfitting, and how to use `eras`. Whether you are a novice or master level data scientist, we highly recommend that you go through these guides!

If you want to learn more about why we have setup the problem this way, check out the book [Advances in Financial Machine Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Advances-Financial-Machine-Learning-Marcos/dp/1119482089) by [Marcos Lopez de Prado](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lopezdeprado/), who is our scientific advisor.

### Submissions

Every weekend, new `tournament_data` is released and a new round begins. To participate in the round, run the new `tournament_data` through your model and submit your predictions back to Numerai.

Submission files look like this. The `id` column must match the one in `tournament_data` exactly. The `prediction` can be any number between 0 and 1 \(exclusive\).

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2830%29.png)

You can upload your submission at any time before the next round opens. However, only submissions made before `Monday 14:30 UTC` are considered on-time. Late submissions will not count towards your score and will not be eligible for payouts or bonuses.

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%285%29.png)

You can upload your submission to our [website](https://numer.ai/) or[ api](https://api-tournament.numer.ai). You can also use the [Python](https://github.com/uuazed/numerapi) and [R](https://github.com/Omni-Analytics-Group/Rnumerai) client libraries to do this programatically.

For advanced users, check out [Numerai Compute](https://docs.numer.ai/tournament/compute) - a framework to help you automate your submission workflow.

### Scoring

Numerai measures performance based on the `rank_correlation` between your predictions and the true targets.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="scoring\_function.py" %}
```python
# method='first' breaks ties based on order in array
ranked_predictions = predictions.rank(pct=True, method="first")
correlation = np.corrcoef(labels, ranked_predictions)[0, 1]
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}


### Staking <a id="staking"></a>

You can `stake` on your model to start earning daily payouts.

Staking requires you to lock up [NMR](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/numeraire/) in an [Erasure](https://github.com/erasureprotocol/erasure-protocol) smart contract agreement. This gives Numerai the ability to grief \(aka burn\) your stake if your performance is poor. This also known as having "skin in the game".

![payout band of Â±1.0 clipped at 0.25](../.gitbook/assets/new_payout_curve.png)

Your round payout is a function of your `stake_value` and `round_correlation` for each round.
The formula for payouts is simple.  It's your `stake_value` * `round_correlation`, with a min/max of +-0.25. 
For example, if your `stake_value` was 100 NMR, and your `round_correlation` was 0.1, you will be payed 10 NMR. 
And if your `round_correlation` was -0.3, you will have 25 NMR burned.  

At the open of each round, your `stake_value` will be locked in, and you will be payed according to that value at the end of the round.

You can create and manage your stake on the [website](http://numer.ai) or directly [on the Ethereum blockchain](https://github.com/numerai/tournament-contracts). Below is an example of staking on the website.

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2832%29.png)

You can increase your stake at any time and it will apply next Thursday. Decreasing works similarly except it always takes an additional 4 weeks.

At the beginning of each Thursday, up to `100K NMR` in stakes will be selected and eligible for payouts. If the total amount staked exceeds this, then all stakes will be selected pro rata.

If you don't already have NMR, you can acquire it on the open market. The easiest way is through [ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) on [Uniswap](https://uniswap.exchange/swap) or through [BTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) on [Changelly](https://changelly.com/), [Upbit](https://upbit.com/exchange?code=CRIX.UPBIT.BTC-NMR), [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-NMR), [Poloniex](https://poloniex.com/exchange#btc_nmr), and [HitBTC](https://hitbtc.com/NMR-to-BTC).

### Leaderboard

Maintaining a consistent high `round_correlation` over time earns you a place on the leaderboard and a large daily bonus.

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2811%29.png)

Your `rank` on the leaderboard depends on your `reputation`, which is the average of your `round_correlation`over the past 20 rounds.
The last 20 `round_correlation`s are weighted in a particular way so that new rounds gradually get incorporated into your `reputation` as they resolve.
Here is an example of the round weights on day 3 for round 204.
![round_weights example](../.gitbook/assets/round_weights.png)

Since each round is 20 days, and round 204 has had 3 days scored so far, round 204 carries a weight of 3/20 or 0.15.
Meanwhile rounds 185 to 188 drop leave the calculation at the same rate that new rounds are being added.  This represents older rounds being less relevant to reputation score than more recent rounds are.
This symmetrical weighting scheme also keeps a consistent weight to the reputation score at all times.

Users are forgiven of one (1) missing round at a time for consideration in the reputation.  
The earliest missing round to be included in reputation will be filled in with the same score that you would have received if you submitted the example_predictions.
Any subsequent missing rounds will receive a very low score of -0.1.
This one-missing-week policy is meant to offer some forgiveness so that if you miss one week due to extraordinary circumstance, that you will not have to wait 20 weeks to climb the leaderboard again.
However, if you miss more than one week, the penalty is very harsh. 
We suggest you set up your models to run on [website](https://docs.numer.ai/tournament/compute) in order to avoid missing weeks.   

Your bonus is a function of your `rank` amongst all staked models \(otherwise known as `staked_rank`\) and your `selected_stake_value` 20 rounds ago. Here, `selected stake value` means Thursday's stake value after applying any stake changes but before applying payouts. For example, if your `selected_stake_value` was 100 NMR and your `staked_rank` is 1, then you will get a 5 NMR bonus. 

Like payouts, bonuses are paid into your stake balance. The max bonus paid out per day is `250 NMR` across all models. If the total bonus amount exceeds this, then all bonuses will be paid pro rata.

| Staked Rank | Daily Bonus |
| :--- | :--- |
| Top 1 | 5% |
| Top 10 | 4% |
| Top 25 | 3% |
| Top 100 | 2% |
| Top 300 | 0.5% |

We reserve the right to refund your stake and void all earnings and burns if we believe that you are actively abusing or exploiting the payout rules.

## Metamodel Contribution

Metamodel Contribution \(MMC\) is a secondary scoring system that rewards uniqueness in conjunction with performance. MMC is scheduled to be released in late Q1 of 2020.

#### Calculation

To calculate a user's \(U\) MMC for a given round we

* select a random 67% of all staking users \(with replacement\)
* assume U staked the mean of these users
* calculate the stake weighted predictions of these users
* score those predictions against the round's real targets using rank correlation.  This gives us score S
* remove U from the 67% of users
* recalulate the stake weighted predictions without U included
* score those new predictions against the real targets.  This gives us S'
* U's MMC = S - S' 
* repeat this whole process 20 times and keep the average MMC score
* Your final MMC score is multiplied by the total number of stakers for the round

#### Design Explanations

* Stake weight is necessary to make the system unattackable
* Sampling a random 67% each time is important to incentivize some redundancy. 

  A very large staker submitting similar predictions to yours would penalize you too much if we didn't do this. 

* Multiplying by the total number of stakers makes the magnitude of MMC stay consistent as the number of users grows.

  Otherwise, as the number of users increases, MMC magnitude would scale down proportionally

#### Payouts

* MMC is \(will be\) payed in a very similar way to the  main tournament.
* It uses the same curve of -1.0 to 1.0, where a score of 0 doesn't effect your stake, 1.0 doubles your stake, and -1.0  burns your whole stake. 
* MMC will be opt-in.  You can choose to put 20% of your stake towards MMC instead of the main tournament.
